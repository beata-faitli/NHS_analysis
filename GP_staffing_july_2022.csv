Notes: ,,,,,
"1 Headcount totals are unlikely to equal the sum of components, due in part to individuals working across multiple roles and areas. Further information on the headcount methodology is available in the Data Quality statement.",,,,,
"2 Figures shown do not include staff working in Prisons, Army Bases, Educational Establishments, Specialist Care Centres including Drug Rehabilitation Centres, Walk-In Centres and other alternative settings outside of traditional general practice such as urgent treatment centres and minor injury units.",,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
3 Figures are published against the regional hierarchy as at 1st July 2022.,,,,,
"4 Data includes estimates for practices that did not provide fully valid staff records. Headcount estimates are produced from full5 estimations only. Details on the percentage of practices requiring full or partial estimation, and the percentage of reported FTE and headcount that is estimated, can be found in Annex A.",,,,,
,,,,,
"5 Full Estimation: Estimates are made for both headcount and full-time equivalent (FTE) for those practices which did not provide any valid data for one or more of the four staff groups (or in the case of practices providing no valid DPC data, DPC estimates are only made for those practices also failing to provide valid data for at least one other staff group). The absence of data for a staff group could be due to poor data quality or no submitted data. For these practices, CCG-level estimations are made. ",,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
"For a detailed explanation of the estimation methodology, see Estimates in the Background Data Quality Statement of the publication.",,,,,
"6 In March 2022, Direct Patient Care advanced practitioner roles were added to the collection tool for the first time. It is likely that this led to the reclassification of some individuals from the corresponding regular roles, resulting in a decrease in the FTE and headcount figures presented for those roles. This should be considered when making comparisons between figures for those job roles prior to March 2022 with figures from March 2022 onwards. See Notice of Changes on the Title and Contents sheet for more information.",,,,,
